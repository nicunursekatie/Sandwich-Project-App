## Overview
This full-stack application for The Sandwich Project nonprofit streamlines sandwich collections, donations, and distributions. It provides comprehensive data management, analytics, and operational tools for volunteers, hosts, and recipients. The project aims to enhance data visibility, support organizational growth, and become a vital tool for food security initiatives, ultimately reducing food waste and hunger.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Design: Button labels and interface text must be extremely clear about their function - avoid ambiguous labels like "Submit" in favor of specific action descriptions like "Enter New Data".
Form Design: Eliminate redundant or confusing form fields - host dialogs should have a single "Host Location Name" field instead of separate "Name" and "Host Location" fields.
Mobile UX Priority: Mobile user experience is critical - chat positioning and space efficiency are key concerns. Vehicle type should NOT be required for new driver entries.
Documentation: All technical findings and fixes must be documented in replit.md to avoid repeated searching and debugging.
Analytics Philosophy: NEVER compare or rank hosts against each other. The Sandwich Project is about increasing volunteer turnout globally, not about which host reported more/less sandwiches. All host comparison features, "top performing hosts", "underperforming hosts", and similar language must be removed from analytics.
Desktop Chat UX: Desktop users require proper scrolling behavior without nested scrolling containers that cause page focus issues - chat layout must handle desktop and mobile differently.

## System Architecture
The application features a React 18 frontend with TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, and Tailwind CSS (with shadcn/ui). The backend uses Express.js (TypeScript), Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL (Neon serverless), including session-based authentication. The UI/UX adheres to The Sandwich Project's official color palette and Roboto typography, prioritizing clarity, responsiveness, and card-based dashboards.
