## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Follow the development workflow:**
   - Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for code standards
   - Write tests first (TDD approach)
   - Implement feature
   - Update documentation
   - Run `npm run test:all`

3. **Deploy to test environment:**
   - Push branch to Replit
   - Test in staging/preview environment
   - Get stakeholder approval

4. **Merge to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Check Sentry for new errors
   - Monitor `/monitoring/dashboard`
   - Verify feature works in production

### Fixing a Bug

1. **Reproduce the bug:**
   - Check Sentry error details
   - Reproduce locally if possible
   - Document reproduction steps

2. **Write a failing test:**
   - Add test that exposes the bug
   - Verify test fails

3. **Fix the bug:**
   - Implement fix
   - Verify test passes
   - Run full test suite

4. **Deploy quickly:**
   - For critical bugs, deploy immediately
   - For minor bugs, batch with next release

### Managing Database Migrations

**Adding a new table or column:**

1. **Update schema:**
   ```typescript
   // shared/schema.ts
   export const newTable = pgTable('new_table', {
     id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
     // ... fields
   });
   ```

2. **Generate migration:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

3. **Apply migration:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push  # Development
   # Production migrations happen automatically on deploy
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Verify migration works locally
   - Test rollback if needed
   - Backup production database before deploying

**WARNING:** Database migrations can break production. Always test locally first!

### Updating Dependencies

**Security patches (safe):**
```bash
npm audit fix
npm run test:all
git commit -am "chore: security updates"
```

**Minor/major updates (risky):**
```bash
npm outdated
npm update <package-name>
npm run test:all  # CRITICAL!
# Test manually in dev environment
# Deploy to staging first
```

### Handling User Issues

1. **Gather information:**
   - What were they trying to do?
   - What happened instead?
   - Browser, device, timestamp

2. **Check logs:**
   - Sentry errors for that user/time
   - Application logs (Winston)
   - Monitoring dashboard

3. **Reproduce:**
   - Try to reproduce locally
   - Check if it's a permissions issue
   - Verify user's role and access

4. **Fix and communicate:**
   - Fix the issue or provide workaround
   - Update user with resolution
   - Document in troubleshooting guide

## Emergency Procedures

### Application is Down

1. **Check Replit status:**
   - Visit https://status.replit.com
   - Check if there's a platform outage

2. **Check health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://[REPLIT_DOMAIN]/monitoring/health
   ```

3. **Check Sentry:**
   - Look for spike in errors
   - Identify root cause

4. **Quick fixes:**
   - Restart the application (Replit console)
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify database connection

5. **If database is down:**
   - Check Neon dashboard: https://console.neon.tech
   - Verify `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` is correct
   - Check database connection limits

6. **Communicate:**
   - Post status update to stakeholders
   - Update users if downtime is extended
   - Document incident for post-mortem

### Data Loss or Corruption

1. **STOP** - Don't make changes that could make it worse
2. **Assess scope:**
   - What data is affected?
   - When did it happen?
   - How many users impacted?

3. **Check backups:**
   - Neon provides automated backups (7-14 days retention)
   - Contact Neon support for restore options

4. **Document everything:**
   - Take screenshots
   - Export affected data if possible
   - Document timeline

5. **Restore from backup:**
   - Test in development first!
   - Coordinate downtime with stakeholders
   - Perform restore in production

6. **Post-mortem:**
   - Document what happened
   - Implement safeguards to prevent recurrence
   - Update runbooks

### Security Incident

1. **Contain the incident:**
   - If credentials are compromised, rotate immediately
   - Lock affected user accounts
   - Take offline if actively being attacked

2. **Assess damage:**
   - Check audit logs (`user_activity_logs` table)
   - Review Sentry errors
   - Check for data exfiltration

3. **Remediate:**
   - Patch vulnerability
   - Force password resets if needed
   - Update security configurations

4. **Notify:**
   - Inform affected users
   - Report to organizational leadership
   - Consider legal/regulatory requirements

5. **Learn:**
   - Document incident
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Update security practices

### SendGrid or Twilio Outage

1. **Verify outage:**
   - Check service status pages
   - Check Sentry for delivery errors

2. **Temporary workaround:**
   - Notifications will queue automatically
   - Consider alternative communication (in-app notifications)

3. **When service restores:**
   - Verify queued notifications process
   - Check for any stuck messages

### Database Connection Issues

1. **Check Neon dashboard:**
   - Verify service is running
   - Check connection limits
   - Review query performance

2. **Common fixes:**
   ```bash
   # Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   echo $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL

   # Check connection from Replit shell
   npm run db:check
   ```

3. **Connection pool exhausted:**
   - Check `/monitoring/database` endpoint
   - Look for slow queries
   - Restart application to reset pool
